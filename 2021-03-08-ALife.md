## This is a post about ALife


Write a devlog.

Find your own examples or check Discord for examples of artificial life (aka a-life) or a project exploring emergence that you have found that relates to the ideas in this text. 

This could either be from an artwork, a computer program or a real life process. Investigate it further online. 

How does it demonstrate emergence/bottom-up design? (Also, be sure to explain what emergence means to you).

Using the class you made for a basic creature, make an array of creature objects. How do they demonstrate emergence?

Include a link to your sketch in your devlog and screenshot (or several)

How does my ecosystem demonstrate emergence
what does emergence mean to me... uncanny connection? seeing a pattern (which doesn't always exist?) form out of a group
Who/what else uses emergence and how
- [dave ackley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJRRu4dJnTI) ? pretty basic but found this very cool
- could also do the bio terra thing or Creatures?
- or find something better
- seems like there is a lot of this stuff, don't know why i am having a hard time finding them
