What does emergence mean to me? Emergence seems to be relating to seeing a larger pattern emerge in artificial life. Something about that alone feels very uncanny, is this a real pattern or implied pattern, is there uncertainty? In general it seems like the patterns that emerge are very certain. In my above example there is a pattern of snail creatures staying in the grass and birds tending to stick to the sky. The birds always go right to left, and the snails favor up and down. These patterns emerged and show evidence of the programer's hand. However, in most emergent patterns it tends to be something that wasn't predicted, a pattern that was not the intention of the programer, something unexpected. In this regard my ecosystem fails to truly show emergence, although perhaps it will soon? I am hoping to make it so that the birds need to eat the snails in order to extend their lives. I want a single plant that collects sunlight and produces food for the snails. I don't know what will happen then, but I'm sure something will emerge! (will life emerge?)

Reminding me of when I had ants my home. At a certain time there would be much more of them and when there was more of them I was able to see the pattern they were following, where they tending to try to find food, and where they were coming from (which allowed me to fill the entry point with caulk). Felt like I was tracking them, but maybe it was more like an emergent pattern forming?

METACREATION!

"the process, known as emergence, by which these simple components interact to produce complex, lifelike results is another central concept in artificial life"

almost seems like the artificial production of life is attributed to emergence. The awareness of a complex pattern/thought. Almost like an awareness of its artificial humanity/authenticity? Mirroring the way natural intelligence is generated, through a collection of thoughts/processes. It is bottom up because the perceived intelligence (top) is coming from the emergent behavior, which emerges from the multitude of decentralized agents (bottom). "this striking emergence of complexity from simplicity, and lifelike dynamics from formal rules", love this quote. The recognition of authenticity/humanity/life coming from the pattern(s) formed from the inhuman code/laws/etc..., also implying the pattern that emerged to have been unpredictable (lifelike, surprise you).

I found something called, ["Darwinian Poetry"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060412133402/http://www.codeasart.com/poetry/darwin.html) , which I thought was very fun/funny. This program randomly generates poems that mate with eachother and exchange words as chromosomes as they evolve. There are different speciels that have varying chances of success as well, and there is a 10% chance of mutation (which is mostly a single word moving one position over). The user also plays a role as we vote on the poems we want to survive.

To me it seems a little weird having artificial life interacting with real life, makes me a bit hesistant to call this artificial life since it is dependent on us? But I guess no matter what it always interacts with biological life, since it is programed and subject to the programmer's aesthetic preferences. Anyway, I like it, and enjoying interacting with it, and there is a lot of evolutionary coding/life occuring behind the scene that illustrates emergences or bottom up intelligence. The words are the bottom, they are decentralized and come to together to create meaning/pattern when we read and perceive them, and then recognize them as poems, or as intelligence (top). 

There seems to be a lot of things like this, I found a random music generater, although to be honest I didn't like the ones I found, and also an evolving screensaver, which also interacts with "natural" life (or well personal computers) in order to evolve. This one is called[Electric Sheep](https://scottdraves.com/sheep.html), from Scott Draves, who created it in 1999. It pulls all of the users (computers sleeping) together to form a "supercomputer" that renders animations that are the screen savers. The screen savers are voting on for survival (sounds barbaric). So the abstract pattern that is formed through all the sleeping computers and their users's voting is the emergence. Which makes sense because it is a deeply complex abstract moving image that seems to flow and move as it is had life (or was directly being controlled by life). A lot of the times they looked like schools of fish or flocks of birds to me. Is emergence really "life" or is it a trick? Does it matter? What is the benefit of creating artificial life? Also, can't stop keep thinking about how weird it is that artificial life feels more lifelike than artificial intelligence.
