Write a devlog.

Find your own examples or check Discord for examples of artificial life (aka a-life) or a project exploring emergence that you have found that relates to the ideas in this text. 

This could either be from an artwork, a computer program or a real life process. Investigate it further online. 

How does it demonstrate emergence/bottom-up design? (Also, be sure to explain what emergence means to you).

Using the class you made for a basic creature, make an array of creature objects. How do they demonstrate emergence?

Include a link to your sketch in your devlog and screenshot (or several)

What does emergence mean to me? Emergence seems to be relating to seeing a larger pattern emerge in artificial life. Something about that alone feels very uncanny, is this a real pattern or implied pattern, is there uncertainty? In general it seems like the patterns that emerge are very certain. In my above example there is a pattern of snail creatures staying in the grass and birds tending to stick to the sky. The birds always go right to left, and the snails favor up and down. These patterns emerged and show evidence of the programer's hand. However, in most emergent patterns it tends to be something that wasn't predicted, a pattern that was not the intention of the programer, something unexpected. In this regard my ecosystem fails to truly show emergence, although perhaps it will soon? I am hoping to make it so that the birds need to eat the snails in order to extend their lives. I want a single plant that collects sunlight and produces food for the snails. I don't know what will happen then, but I'm sure something will emerge!

Reminding me of when I had ants my home. At a certain time there would be much more of them and when there was more of them I was able to see the pattern they were following, where they tending to try to find food, and where they were coming from (which allowed me to fill the entry point with caulk). Felt like I was tracking them, but maybe it was more like an emergent pattern forming?


Who/what else uses emergence and how
- could also do the bio terra thing?
- or find something better
- seems like there is a lot of this stuff, don't know why i am having a hard time finding them
