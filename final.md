1. I want arrows to move stuff
1. want to create some kind of world
1. NO, make a diagram, map, generator, YES, make this awesome and interactive. real and abstract
	- can have a little guy walk/jumping around the map
    	- what/how is best way to do this?
    -  can have enemies as well
    - tells people what to draw, the people are the machines, the computer is the brain 
    	- instructions for drawing, what to do with these drawings, mail them to the White House? a friend, show and tell, ways for presentation, sharing, giving birth to art..........
    	- can there be a way to have people upload drawings and incorporate/save those?
    - still want/need random events, dancing animations, errors, wave of enemies that eat through the diagrams (player needs a way to defend), etc... 
    - needs addition layer, layer of text? Images? What does this need?
    - need a lot of "fun" noises and sounds
    - everything needs to be clickable
    	- movable?
    - needs to be very visually appealing
    - can evolve or restart, 
    	- think about what evolving diagrams means
    - should some be surveys, quizes, vendiagrams, pie chart, you now other things that are diagrams that I'm excluding, or no?

## PROPOSAL

I want to create a procedurally generated diagram generator that does the "art" thinking for you.

## examples of stuff I have 

- [examples of diagrams](https://chrisdivincenzo.github.io/Thesis/diagrams.html) these are the types of diagrams I am hoping to emulate (and evolve?)

## inspiration

not sure lol
