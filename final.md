## PROPOSAL

I want to create a procedurally generated diagram generator. There will be multiple randomized rooms that have different backgrounds and characters that are labeled. I want there to be a "bored" buttom to randomize, as well as an "evolve" button that will trigger some kind of event? (still working on that). There will also be random events that get triggered if nothing is happening, and I want the user to be able to move the text around and cut away labels they don't like. 

## examples of diagrams

- [examples of diagrams](https://chrisdivincenzo.github.io/Thesis/diagrams.html) these are the types of diagrams I am hoping to emulate (and evolve?)

## random ideas
- rooms? mind map, randomize or can you travel from one to the next?
- bored button
- move objects/text around
- can you move a character? or the screen? in a distorted weird way?
- scrolling landscape
- event: pipe breaks in and floods the screen, other hidden interactions that are randomized somewhat
- clicking on things shrinks and kills them, makes a beep boop noise? or just cut them away
- event: simulate unity game from last semester, words blocking, etc
- needs to feel like some kind of world
- make a diagram / map generator,
	- needs to be interactive. real & abstract
		- so like in some way instructional way?
    - characters crawling across screen?
    - event: instructions for user to print out and mail somewhere
    - random events: dancing animations, errors, wave of enemies that eat through the diagrams (player needs a way to defend), etc... 
    - feels like it needs addition layer/ something else?
    - need a lot of "fun" noises and sounds
    - everything needs to be clickable in some way
    - needs to be very visually appealing
    - can evolve or restart, 
    	- think about what evolving diagrams means
        - things moving
        - things growing
        - arrows pointing towards arrows
        - layers of characters
        - noise?
        - should all the text be vibrating
        	- could have chance to fly away, or eat other text
            - or explode
    - options for other kinds of diagrams?
    - should everything be moving?
    - need some interesting way to navigate them, maybe you can move from room to room, make text objects that block your pathway
    - twisted arms, vines and machines instead of arrows? no I think arrows are better
    - mouse pointer could be a pair of scissors 

## plan

1. start simple
1. recreate "zombie" diagram (pink creature blue background)
1. flesh out the array of array of text options
1. then make room selector 
1. make other room possiblities
1. make buttons
1. plan events and incorporate all the other fun stuff

## Questions

taking it slow, will need to figure out a lot of stuff...

1. need to figure out how to make the arrows point towards the creature (feel like I can figure this out), might need to use images of arrows, trying to use triangles and break up the rules for their directions into quadrants but I'm doing somehting wrong and I think if I load four rotations of arrows, (can add more fun options later), and draw them based on the quadrant location of x and y, that would work better
1. how to make the text not overlap, should be able to do something like the grass from the squirrel stuff to make this work, will need to rewatch recording as that part didn't really stick in my brain
1. building text from an array of an array, think I got it now conceptually (so I should be able to figure it out), but I wanted to figure out the easier stuff first so I'm coming back to that
1. (WILL KEEP ADDING TO THIS! Moving a little slowly this week in order to wrap up my thesis draft, will def have many questions along the way! trying to take it one step at a time)
	- honestly though I think these will be my biggest issues, once I figure all that out solidly I think the room control, events, timers, etc... is all stuff I can or have done similar stuff in the past
    - one future possible question, might want to incorporate a (distorted?) video, will cross that bridge later, looked up loading in a video and seems reasonably simple but who knows... wonder if I could wrap a video around an object? hmmm seems like something I will get to after this class is over lol

## Inspiration 

honestly not 100% sure where this idea came from, I started out by wanting to make a diagram for my thesis paper a while ago, kind of as a funny/subversive act I guess, and enjoyed doing it. For my installation I had a critique were people were suggesting hanging up posters or vinyl to go with my work (originally I was like no way, posters?, I have a video why would I do that) and then I was like wait, yes! I should make a bunch of diagrams and hang those up. So the diagrams come from the thesis video and installation I did like a month ago. 

I didn't initially know what to do for this project, I really liked what you did in the online show and was thinking about that a lot, was thinking about ways to deconstruct my thesis video and have all the elements come together in some randomized way, but that felt wrong, and then when I was watching Kate Compton at some random moment I was like oh yes, diagram generator, that's what I need to do! So I guess she inspired me even though I'm not sure how exactly the art toys (think I was watching the flower one at this point) connect to these diagrams lol, but I'm sure theres a conection there somewhere. I also like [Rachel Rossin's](http://rossin.co) work a lot, the aesthetic mixture of real and digital things is something I want to experiment with more, I plan on continuing this project after to incorporate more mixtures of things like this, distorted video of my backyard, etc... although right now (like this second, might feel differently in an hour) my aesthetic, I feel like is more about real things intercepting digital spaces instead of digital things intercepting real spaces? (if that means anything lol). I'm also thinking about Jonah's instructional stuff, something really fun about that and idk if any aspects of that will make it into this project but I might add an event encouraging the viewer to interpretate what the diagrams mean and "do an art" about that, idk, need to think about that more too.
