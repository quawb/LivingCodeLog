## PROPOSAL

I want to create a procedurally generated diagram generator. There will be multiple randomized rooms that have different backgrounds and characters that are labeled. I want there to be a "bored" buttom to randomize, as well as an "evolve" button that will trigger some kind of event? (still working on that). There will also be random events that get triggered if nothing is happening, and I want the user to be able to move the text around and cut away labels they don't like. 

## examples of diagrams

- [examples of diagrams](https://chrisdivincenzo.github.io/Thesis/diagrams.html) these are the types of diagrams I am hoping to emulate (and evolve?)

## random ideas
- rooms? mind map, randomize or can you travel from one to the next?
- bored button
- move objects/text around
- can you move a character? or the screen? in a distorted weird way?
- scrolling landscape
- event: pipe breaks in and floods the screen, other hidden interactions that are randomized somewhat
- clicking on things shrinks and kills them, makes a beep boop noise? or just cut them away
- event: simulate unity game from last semester, words blocking, etc
- needs to feel like some kind of world
- make a diagram / map generator,
	- needs to be interactive. real & abstract
		- so like in some way instructional way?
    - characters crawling across screen?
    - event: instructions for user to print out and mail somewhere
    - random events: dancing animations, errors, wave of enemies that eat through the diagrams (player needs a way to defend), etc... 
    - feels like it needs addition layer/ something else?
    - need a lot of "fun" noises and sounds
    - everything needs to be clickable in some way
    - needs to be very visually appealing
    - can evolve or restart, 
    	- think about what evolving diagrams means
        - things moving
        - things growing
        - arrows pointing towards arrows
        - layers of characters
        - noise?
        - should all the text be vibrating
        	- could have chance to fly away, or eat other text
            - or explode
    - options for other kinds of diagrams?
    - should everything be moving?
    - need some interesting way to navigate them, maybe you can move from room to room, make text objects that block your pathway
    - twisted arms, vines and machines instead of arrows? no I think arrows are better
