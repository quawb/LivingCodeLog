## AARON LOG

_“… perhaps AARON would be better described as an expert’s system than as an expert system: not simply because I have served as both knowledge engineer and as resident expert, but because the program serves as a research tool for the expansion of my own expert knowledge rather than to encapsulate that knowledge for the use of others,” Cohen wrote in 1988."_

Harold Cohen resisted ascribing human-like characteristics or the appearance of sentience to AARON. In the statement above, he describes AARON as a tool for the expansion of his own expert knowledge. This is a software tool. Describe an example of a theoretical tool (for you) that you could use to make an artwork (or dance, theater piece, music, film, etc - depending on your interest and creative practice). What would the tool do? What kind of functions would it have? What might it be called? What limit might it have that would require you to step in and collaborate with your software-tool to finish the piece?

### Quotes that stood out to me:

_"How do Artists process their information in the creation of artworks? What are the minimum conditions under which a set of marks functions as an image? What makes an image evocative? To answer these questions, he began investigating children's drawing and ancient petroglyphs, looking for their "artness"._

_"Cohen had trained AARON to create convincing "Harold Cohen" Paintings"._

_"Was AARON creative? Cohen certainly thoguht that it was not as creative as he had been in creating the program. Who was the artist-Cohen or AARON? Cohen compared it to the relationship between Renaissance painters and their studio assistants. Was the fact that AARON created art works evidence of computer intelligene? On that ,Cohen seemed non-committal, saying that AARON never worked to improve itself, a sure sign of intelligence, but at the same time defending the fact that AARON did just what human artists did, taking knowledge of forms and applying them to the creation process"._
