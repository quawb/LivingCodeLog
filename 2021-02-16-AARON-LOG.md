## AARON LOG

_“… perhaps AARON would be better described as an expert’s system than as an expert system: not simply because I have served as both knowledge engineer and as resident expert, but because the program serves as a research tool for the expansion of my own expert knowledge rather than to encapsulate that knowledge for the use of others,” Cohen wrote in 1988."_

Harold Cohen resisted ascribing human-like characteristics or the appearance of sentience to AARON. In the statement above, he describes AARON as a tool for the expansion of his own expert knowledge. This is a software tool. Describe an example of a theoretical tool (for you) that you could use to make an artwork (or dance, theater piece, music, film, etc - depending on your interest and creative practice). What would the tool do? What kind of functions would it have? What might it be called? What limit might it have that would require you to step in and collaborate with your software-tool to finish the piece?

Whenever I make a video I tend to start out by trying to "improvise", or trying to force randomness out of myself, even though that can never be objectively achieved that way. I feel like this is similar to AARON since the device is programed in a very subjective way, hence the quote _"Cohen had trained AARON to create convincing "Harold Cohen" Paintings"._ In this way my body is just a machine. As I progress through a project, I reapproach ideas and cut them away or feverishly add to them, many times I slap on ready-made PNGs I find on the internet or incorporate quotes or lyrics, either way I am using these other objects as tools to progress my own idea, it is basically a collage, and I might argue that AARON is simply making a collage of Cohen's predescribed ideas. Or better yet, Cohen is using AARON to make a collage of his predescribed ideas.

If I were to use a theoretectical tool to help me make more videos, I would use one that could scroll through my memories and cut a bunch of them together random, so that I could them go through and organize them and manipulate them however I impulsely feel like doing. The organizing and manipulating is the most fun part for me, why bother generating images if I don't have to? Better yet, I would want a tool that uses my memories to create deep fake memories. I could mix these up with real footage and other stuff for super fun times. I'll call it the Mind Scrambler. I would want it to bug out a lot though. I wouldn't want it to do any actually editing though, as I find that the most fun part, but made include a feature that can actually and randomly cut up and mix up fotage. The use of AARON and other tools, software and theoretectical, I think allows for experimentation to immediately take place, which is where the real fun is.  

### Quotes that stood out to me:

_"How do Artists process their information in the creation of artworks? What are the minimum conditions under which a set of marks functions as an image? What makes an image evocative? To answer these questions, he began investigating children's drawing and ancient petroglyphs, looking for their "artness"._

I like this quote becuase 1. it reminded me of LOGO, 2. it makes artists sound like they are computers, and 3. it questions what constitues an image/art
I also was very intrigued by his presentation when he talks about looking for intentionality, the lack of intentionality, and true intentionality not mattering, only the perception of it...

_"Was AARON creative? Cohen certainly thoguht that it was not as creative as he had been in creating the program. Who was the artist-Cohen or AARON? Cohen compared it to the relationship between Renaissance painters and their studio assistants. Was the fact that AARON created art works evidence of computer intelligene? On that ,Cohen seemed non-committal, saying that AARON never worked to improve itself, a sure sign of intelligence, but at the same time defending the fact that AARON did just what human artists did, taking knowledge of forms and applying them to the creation process"._

## No PAINT

Use NoPaint - available as iOS app (for free) or on the web
Make 4 - 10 artworks
Try using the console
Write about using NoPaint. Is it your artwork? Are you the collaborator? Are you incidental? What role does randomness play in this art? Or in your art in general? your life in general?

**RELFECTION**
I like no paint, lol. very fun, I starting looking at other people's work and was very impressed,
