ALGORITHM WALK

- RT 90 degrees
- FD 1 block 
- RT until you are facing away from the sun
- FD (your favorite number between 1 and 4) blocks
- SETPC RANDOM (swap jackets with person closest to you)
- FLIP COIN if heads RT 90 else LT 90
- FD 5 minus (your favorite number between 1 and 4) blocks
- ROLL Die, divide result by 2 and round up to nearest whole number. 
- If result is 1 then LT 90, if 2 then RT 180 if 3 RT 90
- FD 1 block 
- LOOK at phone, if you brought your phone on this walk then 
- PU (the ground is now lava) else (if you didn’t bring your phone) RT 90
- FD (number of notifications you had on your phone) blocks 
- if you didn’t bring your phone then stand still and meditate on algorithmic thinking for five minutes.
- PD (whew no more lava)
- RT (Follow your heart... if you have no heart then turn towards the pathway that sounds most like a heartbeat to you)
- FD roll three dice and pick the one that landed closest to you, go FD that number of blocks
- RT 180*number of blue cars in line of sight
- FD (total number of people you can see) blocks
- LT 90*number of animals you saw this walk
- REPEAT 3 (do jumping jacks for total number of blocks walked)
- GO Home (Home is where your family is)


REFLECTION ON WALK:
first thoughts, I like having to do random actions to determine the fate of my walk, found it funny and it also got us to walk in a new pattern, which is always fun! I used app simulators this time for the coin and the dice since I didn’t have any handy, but I think it would be extra fun to have to bend down and roll dice on the ground to figure out what to do next. Feels like much like I’m immersed in a board game. It also made me a bit more aware of my surrounds as we have been doing the same walk everyday and this broke us out of our habit. unfortunately we did fail right away as there were not enough blocks to go down for the FD favorite number step, so we have to change the favorite number to one in order not to hit a dead end. There was some debate as to which ground was lava, I was walking on the snow to protect me from the lava, but my partner argued that the concrete sidewalk was less ground and therefore safer from the ground lava. I was meant with opposition for the jacket swap as well, that needs debugging. I also estimated how many blocks we walked and how many jumping jacks we did. It actually wasn’t a very long walk all in all. I can definitely see the benefit, or at least the fun, in applying computational thinking to real world situations. It seems like a to-do list to me. Or maybe even a manifesto? 

REFLECTION ON CLASSMATE’S WALK:

Was expecting this one to not be too long, ended up getting far from my house and had a twenty minute walk back. Hit a bunch of places I never walked to before, which I was not expecting to get to now, included the next town’s metro north station. I little not have control over the walk, I do think I am going to start doing walks where I use dice to pick all my directions. I did break the code a bunch though because of the FD 2 blocks (this actually happened with the very first command lol), I kept getting into places where there was only one stretch of street in front of me (had to dodge a highway at one point too). The streets were also very inconstant in size, had to call some of the blocks two streets in order not to exhaust myself. 

Was cool to thnk about this in relation to situationalism, never heard of situationalism before, found this video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SvdWk8zRrI
