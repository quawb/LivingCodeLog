First look at LOGO, was actually very fun for some reason. I started out trying to make weird shapes but then I decided I wanted to make curvy lines that went across the screen.  was thinking of making a snake or idk something like that.

I cleared the screen and then tried using a random feature, but this got too crazy. 
I wanted it to be much more neat, this was too crazy

Then saw the pen color function and had to use that!
this was nice I thought, wasnâ€™t expecting one of the colors to be black but I liked it, kind of looks like rain? Thought about trying to make a disco ball but had no idea where to start.

Next I wanted to see how it looked if I interwove the curvy lines.

Saw some of the uploads to discord and wanted to try to make sometime more recognizable and use setpos, so I made an envelope which was pretty simple and fun.

I got bored of the envelope quickly though and decided to over kill my curvy lines and see what they look like, I was hoping for like a chainlike look or helix thing. looks like melting/glitchy chains I think. This was my favorite!

I started playing with some other methods, I really liked the sun drawing in the discord so I wanted to try that and to use pu. for the quilt I want to make a sun and a moon behind rain
