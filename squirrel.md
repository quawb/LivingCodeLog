## [CODE HERE](https://editor.p5js.org/chrismdv00/sketches/WYFyGV4tx)

## [FULLSCREEN MODE](https://editor.p5js.org/chrismdv00/full/WYFyGV4tx)

## PROCESS

We divided up the things that everyone was doing, but helped each other when we got stuck. I did the enemy squirrels and helped others when they got stuck. After the class I had free time, and enjoy doing this stuff, so I put everyones stuff together and made a couple minor tweaks, like adding in the image for the player squirrel. We then got together on Sunday to tweak the code together, add some features and plan ahead. There was a lot of great brain storming. Russel had the idea to include an acorn that gave the squirrel health, which we all thought was great. Markus had the idea to make all the forest objects have avoid functions. And we had a bunch of crazier ideas that weren't exactly possible in the time frame (one of which involved collecting cyborg parts and turning into a cyborg squirrel and having a boss squirrel appear that you need to shoot lasers at to defeat). Was fun and we are on continuing to work on and debug together through discord. 

## CHALLENGES

1. Never quite figured out how to get the forest objects to not overlap, but they still look really nice dispersed on the screen randomly so we left it like that. 
1. The spritesheet thing we got confused about and just used a GIF instead. 
1. Could not figure out the camera thing for the life of me, idk we tried a bunch of different things but it just didn't work lol. Maybe next time

## ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS

1. eating sounds
1. worked alot on finding the goldilocks level, hope its there? (a lot of the choices we made we made together for this requirement, i.e. asking the group do the squirrels get too big, do they walk funny, etc... which was very helpful to have a group to do that with)
1. the enemy squirrels walking pattern has a noise force on it
1. we have trees and boulders with avoid functions that the effect the player and the enemy squirrel, along when the player is big enough it breaks, which I kinda like because you just like hop over the trees which is funny
1. we also have decorative flowers and bushes
1. what else, acorn that appears when your health is less than 3 that spawns randomly on the map and gives you one health
