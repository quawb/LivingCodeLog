## Experimentations with [Hydra](http://hydra.ojack.xyz)

### Day 1

First thing I wanted to try was sharing the screen, I feel like this has the most potential for me as of right now. One other reason this interested me is becayse the visuals from the concert we watched that I enjoyed the most were the ones were you could see the user, or their desktop, etc... my favorite being the one when the artist was using Unreal Engine. I have a tendancy to overpixelate everything at first, so my visuals quickly deteriorated! Would like to find a middle ground to this deterioration and pixelation. One thing I really liked though was changing what was on my screen, or moving my windows around and seeing the acid wave of pixels shift and sway.

### Day 2

Objectives: 
1. don't go too crazy
1. use camera
1. try out modulate and layers
1. think about how to use this in the future
_also, I took too many pictures...

Started out with using the camera, which was nice because it didn't spiral into destruction, I like the pixelate feature, want to get it to make like shapes or something.

Cool, made the pixelate make everything like shapes, and started using modulate, which is really cool. I like have the camera as the input (even though you can see me), because I can play with the light and etc, so I can change all the colors by putting my finger to the camera. After this I used modulatePixelate, and modulateRotate, but I liked modulateRepeat the most.

thought this one was pretty fun too, and then I went too crazy again...

![four.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/four.jpg)

think I did somewhere weird by mistake and then deleted too much and ended up just starting over after this.
