Day 1

First thing I wanted to try was sharing the screen, I feel like this has the most potential for me as of right now. One other reason this interested me is becayse the visuals from the concert we watched that I enjoyed the most were the ones were you could see the user, or their desktop, etc... my favorite being the one when the artist was using Unreal Engine. I have a tendancy to overpixelate everything at first, so my visuals quickly deteriorated! Would like to find a middle ground to this deterioration and pixelation. One thing I really liked though was changing what was on my screen, or moving my windows around and seeing the acid wave of pixels shift and sway.
