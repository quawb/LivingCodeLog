## Experimentations with [Hydra](http://hydra.ojack.xyz)

### Day 1

First thing I wanted to try was sharing the screen, I feel like this has the most potential for me as of right now. One other reason this interested me is becayse the visuals from the concert we watched that I enjoyed the most were the ones were you could see the user, or their desktop, etc... my favorite being the one when the artist was using Unreal Engine. I have a tendancy to overpixelate everything at first, so my visuals quickly deteriorated! Would like to find a middle ground to this deterioration and pixelation. One thing I really liked though was changing what was on my screen, or moving my windows around and seeing the acid wave of pixels shift and sway.

### Day 2

Objectives: 
1. don't go too crazy
1. use camera
1. try out modulate and layers
1. think about how to use this in the future

_also, I took too many pictures..._

Started out with using the camera, which was nice because it didn't spiral into destruction, I like the pixelate feature, want to get it to make like shapes or something.

![two.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/two.jpg)

Cool, made the pixelate make everything like shapes, and started using modulate, which is really cool. Think this is my favorite. I like having the camera as the input (even though you can't see me), because I can play with the light and etc, so I can change all the colors by putting my finger to the camera. After this I used modulatePixelate, and modulateRotate, but I liked modulateRepeat the most.

thought this one was pretty fun too, and then I went too crazy again...

![four.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/four.jpg)

think I did something somewhere weird by mistake and then deleted too much and ended up just starting over after this.

Went back to start with the camera, and a modulated osc, think this one has a pretty good level of pixelation. I like how my eyes are pink abysses and the unevenness of the osc. 

![six.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/six.jpg)

Lastly, i made this one, which went through a lot of chaos and confusion but I think it ended up pretty cool! I was looking aroudn reference and saw how to send out like four things and blend/modulate them together, still confused on the whole thing but feel like this has potential! I was trying to figure out how to like overlap a video and my camera or something like that but ended up here instead, will need to go back and figure that out when my brain is less fried. 

### The future?

Not exactly sure how I will use this in the future, but I do want to play with it and figure out how I can incorporate it because it feels like there is something here I can use. The first step for me would be to try to run/loop a video into Hydra and play around with the functions. I'm hoping I could screen record that and somehow use that video as a portion of a larger project maybe? I could see myself doing soemthing similar with the camera or the screensharing, recording the effects slowly being layered on and turn into a video. I don't know how I would do this stuff live though, doing things live seems like a whole other beast! I was also thinking of trying to run my ecosystem through this, but idk why, I'm thinking that would actually look quite bad. 

### Intuitive? 

Honestly, I did not find this language very intuitive for me personally. I definitely feel like it is more intuitive for other people though, I had to keep the references open the whole time and keep checking what goes in where, where everything goes (I placed functions in the wrong places a lot), and figuring out what takes how many and which variables. Seems like a lot to memorize, can't imagine people being so comfortable with this they can do it live! But then again I only just started it. 

### what am I doing/Hydra v. p5.js?

guess I'm trying to make interesting patterns, motions, colors. Sometimes trying to distort images for fun. I think I like p5.js more since I can actually build things from scratch which is a fun thing to do, while hydra to me feels more like modeling pixels? (idk if that makes sense) I think my brain is just more used to thinking in terms of p5.js for now (I tend to overthink things which I think works well with p5), although livecoding with p5.js seems even crazier. This whole idea of live anything is very confusing for me. I like that I can see the process and the progression and etc... but I'm just really not used to thinking like that, but I do love the impulsivity/improvisation aspect that comes with live anything, that aspect I find very appealing, and even if all I get from doing this is being more comfortable being impulsive I would be very happy with just that (although I think I will get much more of this than just that). Maybe once I check out how to input an image or web brower I will have more options/ideas!
