### Concept

Where did this come from?

This started out as a diagram generator accompaniment to the thesis installation I did (where I made 8 diagrams). I thought it would be cool if I could have these diagrams "randomly" generated, and since the project involved "cyberzombies" and cyborgs it seemed almost like these diagrams should have been computerized more from the get go.

**Generator on left, original diagrams on right**

Goals:

I wanted something that I found fun and funny, and related to the diagram project I based this off of. I wanted to include all 8 of the diagrams but I ended up only including 3 plus other stuff. I wasnt sure how to do this but I wanted it to have some real world effect, or like a command (i.e. draw your own cyber zombie) or something like that. But couldn't figure out how I wanted to include that? 

### Challenges

Conceptual Worries:

As I continued working through, I kinda of got bored of the diagram generator? It felt flat and I wanted more, so it started to transform into something a little less diagram generatory than I originally intended, and now I feel like all the features are still not fitting together as tightly as I wanted them to. Wish I figured out a soundscape thing for this

Coding Challenges:

I a lot of the aspects I was trying to figure out I had never tried so they took me a while to get right, i.e. having the mushrooms spawn based of off the last one's position, and connecting the arrows to the zombie/cyborg is a way where they weren't in the middle of nowhere or all in the same spot (and could move with the creature).

A big challenge was also reworking everything to fit in this more menu like version, instead of the way you "play" through. Think my code could be much much cleaner, I need a better way to organize, when I can't find a section immediate I get overwhelmed and lost lol, need to label everything better and have like a seperate handwritten list of important functions and variables 

I tried to make the zombie/cyborg creatures able to turn on/off in other rooms, but it just didn't work lol, so I gave up on that for now. feel like i need to restart and really clean up my code and figure out where I want to take this next, think I want more drawing tools, and a way for more things to be diagrammed. 

### Approach

Probably should've planned more. Or well I did plan a lot (just not that thoroughly), and I  change my mind about things often lol. I tried to start out doing all the easiest stuff first and work from there. Towards the end I kinda wanted to fully restart so I could rework eveyrthing since my goals had changed, but I didn't do that (because of time or stubornness).

### Reflecting On Process:

hard lol, fun though, only sort of ended up as a diagram generator, I kind of slipped away into something else. I guess I was more interesting in weird ways to "draw" (mushrooms, buildings, faces). I liked the diagrams a lot and I want to keep looking at this and figure out how to better incorporate them in this as a whole. Need some way to label anything/everything around. I also have like five other diagrams from my installation that I didn't get to work on. I was trying to slow this down a lot, but it still gets overwhelming sometimes. Need to figure out sound, hopefully I can work on that tomorrow before class. the mushrooms and the buildings aren't very pretty either, wondering if I should've done something with pixels? would be cool if I could figure out a way to embed glitches into this. wish I had more time to play around with this, was hard to manage time with thesis and all, but that's life I guess lol. 

### Thinking about the future:

want to do much more. as I worked through this, I wanted to use things like this to get inspiration to do other stuff, not sure if that makes sense... When I was doing all this stuff and would see the random outputs I would get excited and be like, I want to make something esle with this now lol. I really like this whole procedurally generated thing, feel like there is something here I can latch onto, but I haven't fully figured it out yet. I'm so used to working in video and thigns that have one exact same output every time, kinda hard to change that thinking, but I would really like to make some kind of "video-like" experience that is generative (summer project!).
