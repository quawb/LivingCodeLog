### Reflecting On Process:

hard lol, fun though, only sort of ended up as a diagram generator, I kind of slipped away into something else. I guess I was more interesting in weird ways to "draw" (mushrooms, buildings, faces). I liked the diagrams a lot and I want to keep looking at this and figure out how to better incorporate them in this as a whole. Need some way to label anything/everything around. I also have like five other diagrams from my installation that I didn't get to work on. I was trying to slow this down a lot, but it still gets overwhelming sometimes. Need to figure out sound, hopefully I can work on that tomorrow before class. the mushrooms and the buildings aren't very pretty either, wondering if I should've done something with pixels? would be cool if I could figure out a way to embed glitches into this. wish I had more time to play around with this, was hard to manage time with thesis and all, but that's life I guess lol. 

### Thinking about the future:

want to do much more,
as I work through this, I want to use things like this to get inspiration to do other stuff, not sure if that makes sense... When I was doing all this stuff and would see the random outputs I would get excited and be like, I want to make something esle with this now lol.
