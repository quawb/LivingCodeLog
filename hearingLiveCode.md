I should've taken more screenshots, this is the only one I remembered to take!

Regardless, had a lot of fun playing with someone, I was actually quite nervous about this, I guess live anything makes me nervous. Its been a while since I have done anything with music, I had learned a decent amount of music stuff in the past but honestly I stopped really playing, but I found this really fun. I played around a bunch by myself before I made the ensemble room. I actually went through the whole cheat sheet and made my own reduced cheat sheet of samples I liked, yeah I know I'm a little crazy but I felt like I needed something infront of me to reference and help me think of what I wanted to do next, otherwise I would plateau. It was definately more fun playing with someone else though. Sometimes on my own I would get stuck, but there are much more ideas to bounce around with someone else and I like stopping and listening to what they are doing and then trying something different then I was originally planning. 

Things I like doing:
- starting out with just ```s "fire"```
- building in atmosphere and more "natural" noises
- shifting into more musical instruments 
- and cosmic sounds
- love using ```# n (irand x)```
- then bring everything back to fire
- also love ```s "alphabet numbers"```

I want to try to make more things with ```# note``` chords and etc, feel like that would be cool, I made a nice three note piano chord pattern that I was happy with, but it would be cool to make like a melody or something. Also the delay function seems to never work the way I want it to lol, will need to figure that out. 

here's a screenshot of something I did on my own:

and here's a nice ending I ended up with

You can probably tell I really like the random feature, I wish I could make random notes though, maybe there is a way to do that, I will look into that at some point!
