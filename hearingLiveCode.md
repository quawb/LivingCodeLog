I should've taken more screenshots, this is the only one I remembered to take!

Regardless, had a lot of fun playing with someone, I was actually quite nervous about this, I guess live anything makes me nervous. I played around a bunch by myself before I made the ensemble room. It was definately more fun playing with someone else though, even though I'm not sure who I was playing with lol. Sometimes on my won I would get stuck, but there are much more ideas to bounce around with someone else and I like stopping and listening to what they are doing and then trying something different, etc. I was surprised how quickly the time went by while we were doing this.

Things I like doing:
- starting out with just ```s "fire"```
- building in atmosphere and more "natural" noises
- shifting into more musical instruments 
- and cosmic sounds
- love using ```# n (irand x)```
- then bring everything back to fire
